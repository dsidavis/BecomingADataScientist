# Disclaimer:

+ What I'll talk about are ideals, things we all should aspire to for being the best Data Scientist we can be.
 + don't worry if you don't have these, it doesn't exclude you
 + and very few people have even half of these.
 + But try to get these skills & experiences

+  Focusing on Data Analysis side of Data Science
   + Less on Data Engineering
      + Closer to software development and systems

# What is Data Science

<center>
    <i>"you love data, gleaning insights from data, and making decisions based on data." </i>
</center>
<!-- https://www.kaggle.com/jobs/18452
     Glassdoor Data Scientist position.
   -->

+ Data-enabled discovery
+ Problem solving with data

+ **Uses** Math, Stat, CS, methods and technologies
  + Not focus - means to an end
  + Focus is on the discovery, interpretation and problem solving.


---
# Data Science 
+ Work in "teams", with non-data scientists.
+ Lot of data cleaning & messy data.
+ Fusing data sources.
+ Different formats and technologies.
+ Stat. Machine Learning (ML) important but short part of job.
+ Should enjoy
   + data sleuthing, messy data, automation and problem solving
   + finding novel insights.

---
# Summary
+ Learn Data Science by doing Data Science projects.
   + Try to come up with your own.
+ Solve real interesting problems (not textbook problems)
  + Develop portfolio - Web pages, github repository of projects
     + With README.md file summarizing the projects &amp; results
+ Work in groups
+ Learn the workflow technologies
   + git, reproducible documents, ...
+ Show you can learn new techologies, methods, etc.
---

# Data-enabled Workflow

+ Frame question
  + Identify all stakeholders and the right question and
     + who cares? why? and about what results?

+ What is the nature of the data that can address the questions.

+ How do we get the data?
   + Exists - Database, scraping, ...
   + Doesn't exist - collect
      + survey, sensors,
   + Sampling Scheme, population and "scope of inference"

+ Explore Data (EDA) 
   + adapt question
+ Clean, transform and organize Data
+ "Modeling" - Stat/Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.
+ Interpretation and conclusions - stakeholders
+ Communicate insights
---

+ Best Data Science is about finding new opportunities to use data for new opportunities
   + new products for business
   + new eficiencies
   + retaining customers
   + new insights for policy, environment, health, things people can relate to.

+ Different from
     + focusing on the engineering  - methods, software, math, stat, CS,... - formal methods.
     + working with data that are given to you, but
       + instead you frame the question and opportunity.
     + But you have to know those also,
       + or have a team who can implement these and that you understand 
       + manager of data science team *may* be able to identify the "opportunities"
         better than the data scientists

---
Learn to learn new things
  + Need to be able to adapt, keep up with new developments
  + Know what is hype, substantive, common sense, critical thinking, judgement

---
Usual things
 + Stat & ML
 + Math
 + Programming (R, Python, Javascript, C++, ...)
 + Technologies - so many different areas and technologies
   + SQL
   + distributed computing, Spark, Docker, ...
 + workflow - git, reproducibility/dynamic documents
 + Interactive graphics, dashboards...
 + Text manipulation & Mining
 + Natural Language Processing.

<!--
Most people focus on these technical aspects.
  + and ignore the "hardest" part -
    + framing questions
    + identifying relevant data
    + interpreting data & results and making decisions with data
   -->

---
# More than applying Statistical Methods

  + Understand and check assumptions of methods
    + Understand what happens when assumptions are violated.
      + Often fine.

  + Use two different statistical methods and compare results
    + Results should not be dependent on choice of method but driven by the data
    + Parametric and non-parametric, e.g.
    + If get different results, tells you important information
      + Can adjust approach based on differences
      + Perhaps combine as an ensemble

<!--
+ Math is less important than answering the right question.
  + This means understanding the scope of the sampling
  + The applicability of the methods

# Recommend
  + Doing real data science, not just textbook questions/problems.
  + Be comfortable actually making decisions with data and being able to justify them
     + Not just applying methods
     + Own the results - be able to critique the limitations but know why you still believe
         the results
  + Show that you can actually do this - Develop Portfolio of projects
     + Work in teams
        + Keeps things going when you don't have time
	+ Learn team work - pros and cons!
	+ Learn from each other

---
# Recommend
  + Show you can 
    + "hit the ground running"
    + can find the answers to questions
    + learn to learn new things
      + be able to identify hype and substantive ideas, methodology, technology. 

  + Learn to work in a team
     + Read other people's code
     + Share and reuse code
     + brainstorm about positive approaches
     + critique 
     
---
# Important Skills

+ Computational reasoning rather than syntax and programming skills.

+ Attention to detail in getting right results
  + i.e. not "I made a mistake, the results are wrong"

+ So learn to debug and verify each step.

---

# At least as Important
## "Soft Skills"

+ Insights and Interpretation.
+ Communication - oral and written.
+ Visualization - presentation and exploratory.
+ Stakeholder understanding/analysis.
+ Biases and Relevance/Appropriateness of data.
+ Ethics, privacy. 
+ Project management.

---
# Characteristics.
+ Be curious
+ Ask questions
  + Don't be afraid to show your ignorance
  + Sign of willingness to learn and contribute
+ Be skeptical & critical
+ Be imaginative and creative.
